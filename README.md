This is a script for modding a Nintendo 3ds, based on the guides provided at https://3ds.hacks.guide


Requirements:

Python 3.9

Windows

ALL LIBRARIES USED IN THE SCRIPT COME DEFAULT WITH PYTHON, NOTHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED IF YOU HAVE PYTHON 3.9

This program will download files to your computer, all file download sources will be listed below, as well as commented in the source code

This program also assumes you're running on Windows. I may make a cross platform script at some point, but I don't have a Mac or Linux machine to troubleshoot on, so it may never happen

This was made for a school project, it will NOT be the most up to date guide. For the most up to date guides, please visit the hacks.guide website or their discords
